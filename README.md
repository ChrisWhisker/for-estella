# Untitled Gardening Game

Grow your garden faster and taller than your opponent. At the end of a match, the player with the highest total plant size across all their plants wins. Plant seedlings, water your shrubs, and sabotage your enemy by chopping down both them and their plants. When you run out of seeds, collect more by walking under the large trees.
