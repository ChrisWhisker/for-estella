# Beat Around The Bush (working title)
Grow your garden faster and taller than your opponent. The player with the biggest garden at the end of the match wins. Plant seedlings, water your shrubs, and sabotage your adversary by chopping down both them and their plants. When you run out of seeds, collect more by walking under the large trees.
